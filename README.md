### Before Deployment
For env variables in production, i used s3 bucket. Simply upload your file to s3 then via github actions you can download from s3 to project directory to read variables.

- Setup AWS CLI for your [OS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-quickstart.html)
- Upload your example file below;
```
touch env.json
nano env.json
```
```json
{
"DB_NAME":"PROD_DB_NAME",
"DB_USER":"PROD_DB_USER",
"DB_PASS":"PROD_DB_PASS",
"DB_HOST":"PROD_DB_HOST",
"DB_PORT":3306
}
```
Finally,
```
aws s3 cp env.json  s3://awsbucketvitae/

```

In order to deploy the project, you need to run the following command:

```bash
$ serverless deploy
```

After running deploy, you should see output similar to:

```bash

"DB_HOST":"172.17.0.3",
"DB_PORT":3306
}
```

```bash
npm run dev
```
